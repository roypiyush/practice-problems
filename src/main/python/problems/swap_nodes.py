# A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by any one of the following properties:
#
#     It can be an empty (null).
#     It contains a root node and two subtrees, left subtree and right subtree. These subtrees are also binary tree.
#
# Inorder traversal is performed as
#
#     Traverse the left subtree.
#     Visit root (print it).
#     Traverse the right subtree.
#
# (For an Inorder traversal, start from the root and keep visiting the left subtree recursively until you reach the leaf
# ,then you print the node at which you are and then you visit the right subtree.)
#
# We define depth of a node as follow:
#
#     Root node is at depth 1.
#     If the depth of parent node is d, then the depth of current node wll be d+1.
#
# Swapping: Swapping subtrees of a node means that if initially node has left subtree L and right subtree R, then after
# swapping left subtree will be R and right subtree L.
#
# Eg. In the following tree, we swap children of node 1.
#
#                                 Depth
#     1               1            [1]
#    / \             / \
#   2   3     ->    3   2          [2]
#    \   \           \   \
#     4   5           5   4        [3]
#
# Inorder traversal of left tree is 2 4 1 3 5 and of right tree is 3 5 1 2 4.
#
# Swap operation: Given a tree and a integer, K, we have to swap the subtrees of all the nodes who are at depth h,
# where h âˆˆ [K, 2K, 3K,...].
#
# You are given a tree of N nodes where nodes are indexed from [1..N] and it is rooted at 1. You have to perform T swap
# operations on it, and after each swap operation print the inorder traversal of the current puzzleNode of the tree.
#
# Input Format
# First line of input contains N, number of nodes in tree. Then N lines follow. Here each of ith line (1 <= i <= N)
# contains two integers, a b, where a is the index of left child, and b is the index of right child of ith node. -1 is
# used to represent null node.
# Next line contain an integer, T. Then again T lines follows. Each of these line contains an integer K.
#
# Output Format
# For each K, perform swap operation as mentioned above and print the inorder traversal of the current puzzleNode of tree.
#
# Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 1024
# 1 <= T <= 100
# 1 <= K <= N
# Either a = -1 or 2 <= a <= N
# Either b = -1 or 2 <= b <= N
# Index of (non-null) child will always be greater than that of parent.

# Explanation
#
# **[s] represents swap operation is done at this depth.
#
# Test Case #00: As node 2 and 3 has no child, swapping will not have any effect on it. We only have to swap the child
# nodes of root node.
#
#     1   [s]       1    [s]       1
#    / \      ->   / \        ->  / \
#   2   3 [s]     3   2  [s]     2   3
#
# Test Case #01: Swapping child nodes of node 2 and 3 we get
#
#     1                  1
#    / \                / \
#   2   3   [s]  ->    2   3
#    \   \            /   /
#     4   5          4   5
#
# Test Case #02: Here we perform swap operations at the nodes whose depth is either 2 and 4 and then at nodes whose
# depth is 4.
